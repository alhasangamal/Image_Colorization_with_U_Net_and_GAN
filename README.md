# Image_Colorization_with_U_Net_and_GAN

This project aims at colouring images using deep learning models. Our project has its base on one of such works, which uses a variant ofGAN and U-Net. We intend to enhance this model by making subtle changes to the architecture and using grayscale images as elementary units, which may lead to better color images.
